# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



## How to Play

*Objective:*  
Match all the pairs of cards before you run out of moves, and try to complete each level as fast as possible!

*Select a Difficulty Level:*  
Your game features five levels of difficulty with different grid sizes:
- *2x2 Grid:* Perfect for a quick warm-up.
- *4x4 Grid:* A moderate challenge.
- *6x6 Grid:* Increase your memory skills.
- *8x8 Grid:* For experienced players.
- *10x10 Grid:* The ultimate memory challenge.

*Gameplay:*
- *Limited Moves:* Each level has a fixed number of moves. Plan your strategy carefully!
- *Card Flipping:* Click a card to reveal its number, then click another card to try and find its matching pair.
- *Matching Pairs:* When you reveal a matching pair, those cards stay visible. If they don't match, they flip back after a brief delay.
- *Advancing:* Complete the level within the allowed moves to progress to the next, more challenging grid size.

*Game Outcome:*
- *Win or Lose:* At the end of each game, whether you win or lose, the total time taken to play is displayed.
- *Beat Your Record:* Try to improve your speed and efficiency as you challenge yourself on higher difficulty levels!
